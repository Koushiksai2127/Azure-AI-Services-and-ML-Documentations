Azure AI Foundry (Foundation for the Copilot Era)

Azure AI Foundry is the **unified platform layer** for building modern AI applications on Azure.  
Think of it as the **control plane** for Generative AI, Agents, and Copilot-style systems.

Instead of working with isolated services, Azure AI Foundry brings together:
- Models
- Data
- Tools
- Evaluation
- Safety & governance

into **one cohesive developer experience**.

### 1.1 Why Azure AI Foundry Matters

Modern AI systems are no longer single-model applications.

They are:
- Multi-model
- Tool-augmented
- Data-grounded
- Safety-aware
- Continuously evaluated

Azure AI Foundry exists to support **this exact reality**.

It is the platform Microsoft uses internally for:
- Microsoft Copilot
- Enterprise AI agents
- AI-powered business workflows

### 1.2 Core Capabilities of Azure AI Foundry

| Capability | What It Enables |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Model Catalog** | Access to Azure OpenAI, open-source, and foundation models |
| **Prompt & Agent Design** | Build prompts, chains, and agent workflows |
| **Evaluation & Monitoring** | Measure quality, safety, latency, and cost |
| **Data Grounding** | Connect models to enterprise data (RAG patterns) |
| **Safety & Governance** | Content filters, logging, policy enforcement |
| **Deployment** | Production-ready endpoints with scaling |

### 1.3 Where Azure AI Foundry Fits Architecturally

Azure AI Foundry sits **above individual AI services** and **below your application**.

This separation is critical for:
- Enterprise scalability
- Model swapping
- Compliance
- Long-term maintainability
